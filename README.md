# CMake_Base
Simple VSCode template for C++ projects managed with CMake. Includes a clang format specification, .vscode folder and doctest integration for testing.
Before using the template you should uncomment the .vscode line in .gitignore and delete/change this README. If you want to clone this repository you should use
```shell
    git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/BeastHunter19/CMake_Base.git
```
and then just delete the .git folder, so that you can then initialize your own git repo when you create the project
```shell
    rm -rf ./CMake_Base/.git
```
